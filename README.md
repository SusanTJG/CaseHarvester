# Case Harvester
Case Harvester is a project designed to mine the [Maryland Judiciary Case Search](http://casesearch.courts.state.md.us/casesearch/inquiry-index.jsp) (MJCS) and build a near-complete database of Maryland court cases that can be queried and analyzed without the limitations of the MJCS interface. It is designed to leverage [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) for scalability and performance.

If you are a researcher or journalist and would like access to our database, please reach out to us at [caseharvester@disman.tl](mailto:caseharvester@disman.tl).
